# Data Pipeline with R : Exercises 

The purpose of this Github repository is to make available the data to complete the exercises in the book ["Data Pipeline with R"](https://warin.ca/dpr/) 

In this book, you will learn some fundamentals about coding with R, its grammar, its vocabulary, as well as some of the best practices in dealing with data, doing some data wrangling, and visualizing data on graphs and dashboards.

You will thus learn how to use R with data and how to produce your desired output such as a graph or a full report. We will thus introduce Markdown as another language for the production part of your work, and we will introduce Git (and Github) in order to make you go through the whole circle in terms of data pipeline.

The goal is to make you comfortable with the new technologies used in data science. It is seems maybe overwhelming, but with just R, Markdown and Git, you will build your data pipeline. This pipeline will serve as the basis of any further analysis.

## Chapter 2: Markdown

To get familiar with Markdown, you must reproduce this [report](https://warin.ca/sessions/exercises/dpr/chap2/chap2-markdown.html). A copy and images are also available in the [chapter2](https://github.com/warint/DPR/tree/main/chapter2) folder. It needs to be perfectly identical. Make sure that you respect the different levels of headings and the typography. Do not forget to add images and the html link.

## Chapter4: Managing References

To the report done in Chapter 2, let's add references! Get the bib file in the [chapter4](https://github.com/warint/DPR/tree/main/chapter4) folder. This is what the [report with references](https://warin.ca/sessions/exercises/dpr/chap4/chap4-managing-references.html) should look like.

## Chapter 6-9: Data Wrangling

This exercise begins in Chapter 6 and continues through Chapter 9. This exercise is therefore divided into 4 parts. For this exercise, you'll work with a csv file available in the [chapter6](https://github.com/warint/DPR/tree/main/chapter6/data) folder.

## Chapter 10: Data Visualization

You must use the data available in the [chapter10](https://github.com/warint/DPR/tree/main/chapter10) folder and reproduce the line and bar chart.  

## Chapter 11: Dashboards

You are in charge of organizing a presentation to the board of directors of an international investment firm. They need to decide in which country they want to invest.

We expect you to do a dynamic presentation using Flexdashboard. You can find an example [here](https://warin.ca/sessions/exercises/dpr/chap11/chap11-dashboards.html). The data are available in the [chapter11](https://github.com/warint/DPR/tree/main/chapter11) folder.
