# Data Pipeline with R : Exercises 

The purpose of this Github repository is to make available the data to complete the exercises in the book ["Data Pipeline with R"](https://warin.ca/dpr/) 

In this book, you will learn some fundamentals about coding with R, its grammar, its vocabulary, as well as some of the best practices in dealing with data, doing some data wrangling, and visualizing data on graphs and dashboards.

You will thus learn how to use R with data and how to produce your desired output such as a graph or a full report. We will thus introduce Markdown as another language for the production part of your work, and we will introduce Git (and Github) in order to make you go through the whole circle in terms of data pipeline.

The goal is to make you comfortable with the new technologies used in data science. It is seems maybe overwhelming, but with just R, Markdown and Git, you will build your data pipeline. This pipeline will serve as the basis of any further analysis.

## Chapter 2: Markdown Exercise

To get familiar with Markdown, you must reproduce the report in the folder named *chapter2*, it needs to be perfectly identical. Make sure that you respect the different levels of headings and the typography. Do not forget to add images and the html link. 

We recommend you to review your courses with the [Chapter 2](https://warin.ca/dpr/markdown.html) and consult the R Markdown [Cheat Sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)

## Chapter 6-9: Data Wrangling

For this exercise, you will have to do some data wrangling. Do not hesitate to go back and read chapters 6,7,8 and 9. 

You must clean the chapter9data.csv and combine the locations data set to it. Make sure that you follow the steps explained in the book.

Pay attention, every little detail is important!


## Chapter 10: Data Visualization

You must use the previous data and calculate the mean gdp per country. With the results, you will create a bar chart identical to the one in the exercise. 

## Chapter 11: Dashboard

You are in charge of organizing a presentation to the board of directors of an international investment firm. They need to decide in which country they want to invest.

We expect you to do:

a dynamic presentation using a flexdashboard
using for instance GDP and Foreign Direct Investment since at least 1995
using for instance France as a country
